Use numbersapi.com/[integer] to get trivia about certain numbers.
Using a searchbox you can get 1 trivia about the entered number from the site.

This number and its trivia is saved in a sqllite database. One number can have multiple trivia, but we do not want the same trivia to get saved twice.

Create another page that shows all the searched numbers and their respective trivia. Link to this page from the main page.
